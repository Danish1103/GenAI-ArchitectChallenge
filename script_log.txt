It is built upon existing transformer-based text representations and incorporates technologies for enhanced robustness and faster training . Additionally, DTE offers pretrained models for in-context learning, aiding in finding semantically similar natural language utterances . These models can be further finetuned for tasks like prompt crafting, improving the performance of downstream inference models such as GPT-3 . However, such finetuning may require a substantial amount of data .
